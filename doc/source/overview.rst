IBiSA_tools, which stands for "Ion Binding State Analysis tools", provides a computational tools for analyzing ion conduction mechanisms hidden in the molecular dynamics (MD) trajectory data. This analysis provides a varitery of information about each ion conduction event and overall properties. See the citations for details of theory and applications.
